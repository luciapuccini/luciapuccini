# Issue Quality Enhancer
Enhance new issues to make them clear, well-structured, and easy to understand.
## Issue to enhance
| Field  | Value          |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Number | #$ISSUE_NUMBER |
| Author | @$ISSUE_AUTHOR |
| Title  | $ISSUE_TITLE   |
| Body   | $ISSUE_BODY    |
## Your tasks
### 1. Get context
- Read the README to understand the project
- List the repository labels (you'll need them later)
### 2. Translate if needed
- If the issue is NOT in English, translate it to English
- Keep all technical details intact
### 3. Improve the title
Add an emoji prefix based on the issue type:
- 🐛 Bug
- ✨ Feature
- 📝 Docs
- 🔧 Refactor
- ⚡ Performance
Example: `🐛 Fix login error when password contains special characters`
### 4. Restructure the body
Use clear sections with emoji headers:
**For bugs:**
```
## 🐛 Description
## 📋 Steps to Reproduce
## ✅ Expected vs ❌ Actual Behavior
```
**For features:**
```
## ✨ Description
## 🎯 Why is this needed?
## 📐 Proposed Solution
```
### 5. Add footer
```

> ✍️ *Enhanced by Copilot. Original author: @$ISSUE_AUTHOR*
```
### 6. Apply changes
- **Update** issue #$ISSUE_NUMBER with the new title and body
- **Assign** 1-3 relevant labels
- **Comment** with a brief summary of improvements
## Rules
- Never change the original meaning
- If already well-written, make minimal changes
- Keep it helpful, not verbose
