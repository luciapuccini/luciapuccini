      <h2>A bit about me</h2>
      <p>
        As a highly experienced software developer with a focus on front-end
        development using React and Next.js, I have developed a deep
        understanding of the latest technologies and best practices. Over the
        past five years, I have worked with a range of startups, helping to
        bring their products to market and drive their success. I am currently
        working at Gartner, and my passion for front-end development drives me
        to constantly learn and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and
        technologies. I look forward to discussing my experience and
        qualifications in more detail and learning more about how my skills can
        contribute to your team's success.
